# Developing Quilt

## Developer Setup

### Install Go

The project is written in Go and supports Go version 1.8 or later. Install
Go using your package manager (Go is commonly referred to as "golang" in
package managers and elsewhere) or via the
[Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

If you've never used Go before, we recommend reading the overview to Go
workspaces [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces). In short,
you'll need to configure the `GOPATH` environment variable to be the location
where you'll keep all Go code. For example, if you'd like your Go workspace
to be `$HOME/gowork`:

```console
export GOPATH="$HOME/gowork"
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
```

Add these commands to your `.bashrc` so that they'll be run automatically each
time you open a new shell.

### Download Quilt

Clone the Quilt repository into your Go workspace using `go get`:

```console
$ go get github.com/quilt/quilt
```

This will install Quilt in your Go workspace at
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/quilt/quilt`, and compile Quilt. After running
installing Quilt, the `quilt` command should execute successfully in your shell.

<aside class="notice">If you use git to clone the Quilt repository, make sure
that you clone it to the directory
<code class="prettyprint">$GOPATH/src/github.com/quilt/quilt</code>.
The Go language is opinionated about the directory structure of code, and if
you don't put Quilt in the expected location, you'll run into errors when you
use Go to compile Quilt.</aside>

Note that if you've previously installed Quilt with npm, there will be
another Quilt binary installed on your machine (that was downloaded during the
npm installation).  If you want to develop Quilt,
you probably want to make sure that when you run `quilt`, the version you're
developing (that was compiled from the Go code) gets run, and not the Quilt
release that was downloaded from npm. Check that this is the case:

```console
$ which quilt
/Users/kay/gowork/bin/quilt
```

If running `which quilt` results in a path that includes your `$GOPATH$`, like
the one above, you're all set.  If it instead returns someplace else, e.g.,
`/usr/local/bin/quilt`, you'll need to fix your `$PATH` variable so that
`$GOPATH/bin` comes first.

### Building Quilt

To build Quilt, run `go install` in the Quilt directory. To do things beyond
basic build and install, several additional build tools are required.  These
can be installed with the `make go-get` target.

If you're developing the the @quilt/quilt package, you must also tell Node.js
to use your local development copy of the Quilt JavaScript bindings by running:

```console
$ npm link .
```
in the directory that contains your local Quilt source files. For each blueprint
that uses the Quilt JavaScript bindings, you must also run:

```console
$ npm link @quilt/quilt
```

in the directory that contains the blueprint JavaScript files.

### Protobufs
If you change any of the proto files, you'll need to regenerate the protobuf
code. We currently use protoc v3. On a Mac with homebrew, you can install protoc v3
using:

```console
$ brew install protobuf
```

On other operating systems you can directly download the protoc binary
[here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases), and then add it to your `$PATH`.

To generate the protobufs simply call:

```console
$ make generate
```

### Dependencies
We use [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) for dependency
management. If you are using Go 1.5 make sure `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` is set to 1.

To add a new dependency:

1. Run `go get foo/bar`
2. Edit your code to import `foo/bar`
3. Run `govendor add +external`

To update a dependency:

```console
$ govendor update +vendor
```

### Developing the Minion
Whenever you develop code in `minion`, make sure you run your personal minion
image, and not the default Quilt minion image.  To do that, follow these steps:

1. Create a new empty repository on your favorite registry -
[docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) for example.
2. Modify `quiltImage` in [cfg.go](../cloud/cfg/cfg.go) to
point to your repo.
3. Modify `Version` in [version.go](../version/version.go) to be "latest".
This ensures that you will be using the most recent version of the minion
image that you are pushing up to your registry.
4. Create a `.mk` file (for example: `local.mk`) to override variables
defined in [Makefile](../Makefile). Set `REPO` to your own repository
(for example: `REPO = sample_repo`) inside the `.mk` file you created.
5. Create the docker image: `make docker-build-quilt`
   * Docker for Mac and Windows is in beta. See the
   [docs](https://docs.docker.com/) for install instructions.
6. Sign in to your image registry using `docker login`.
7. Push your image: `make docker-push-quilt`.

After the above setup, you're good to go - just remember to build and push your
image first, whenever you want to run the `minion` with your latest changes.

## Contributing Code

We highly encourage contributions to Quilt from the Open Source community!
Everything from fixing spelling errors to major contributions to the
architecture is welcome.  If you'd like to contribute but don't know
where to get started, feel free to reach out to
[us](http://quilt.io/#contact) for some guidance.

The project is organized using a hybrid of the Github and Linux Kernel
development workflows.   Changes are submitted using the Github Pull Request
System and, after appropriate review, fast-forwarded into master.
See [Submitting Patches](#submitting-patches) for details.

### Coding Style
The coding style is as defined by the `gofmt` tool: whatever transformations it
makes on a piece of code are considered, by definition, the correct style.  In
addition, `golint`, `go vet`, and `go test` should pass without warning on all
changes.  An easy way to check these requirements is to run `make lint check`
on each patch before submitting a pull request. Running `make format` will fix
many (but not all) formatting errors.

Unlike official go style, in Quilt lines should be wrapped to 89 characters.
This requirement is checked by `make lint`.

The fundamental unit of work in the Quilt project is the git commit.  Each
commit should be a coherent whole that implements one idea completely and
correctly. No commits should break the code, even if they "fix it" later.
Commit messages should be wrapped to 80 characters and begin with a title of
the form `<Area>: <Title>`.  The title should be capitalized, but not end
with a period.  For example, `provider: Move the provider interfaces into the
cloud directory` is a good title. When possible, the title should fit in
50 characters.

All but the most trivial of commits should have a brief paragraph below the
title (separated by an empty line), explaining the _context_ of the commit.
Why the patch was written, what problem it solves, why the approach was taken,
what the future implications of the patch are, etc.

Commits should have proper author attribution, with the full name of the commit
author, capitalized properly, with their email at the time of authorship.
Commits authored by more than one person should have a `Co-Authored-By:` tag at
the end of the commit message.

### Submitting Patches
Patches are submitted for inclusion in Quilt using a Github Pull Request.

A pull request is a collection of well formed commits that tie together
in some theme, usually the larger goal they're trying to achieve.  Completely
unrelated patches should be included in separate pull requests.

Pull requests are reviewed by one person: either by a committer, if the code was
submitted by a non-committer, or by a non-committer otherwise. You do not
need to choose a reviewer yourself; [quilt-bot](https://github.com/quilt-bot)
will randomly select a reviewer from the appropriate group. Once the reviewer
has approved the pull request, a committer will merge it.

Once the patch has been approved by the first reviewer, quilt-bot will assign a
committer to do a second (sometimes cursory) review. The committer will
either merge the patch, provide feedback, or if a great deal of work is
still needed, punt the patch back to the original reviewer.

It should be noted that the code
review assignment is just a suggestion. If a another contributor, or member of
the public for that matter, happens to do a detailed review and provide a `+1`
then the assigned reviewer is relieved of their responsibility.  If you're not
the assigned reviewer, but would like to do the code review, it may be polite
to comment in the PR to that effect so the assigned reviewer knows they need
not review the patch.

We expect patches to go through multiple rounds of code review, each involving
multiple changes to the code.  After each round of review, the original author
is expected to update the pull request with appropriate changes.  These changes
should be incorporated into the patches in their most logical places.  I.E.
they should be folded into the original patches or, if appropriate inserted as
a new patch in the series.  Changes _should not_ be simply tacked on to the end
of the series as tweaks to be squashed in later -- at all stages the PRs should
be ready to merge without reorganizing commits.

## Code Structure
Quilt is structured around a central database (`db`) that stores information about
the current state of the system. This information is used both by the global
controller (Quilt Global) that runs locally on your machine, and by the `minion`
containers on the remote machines.

### Database
Quilt uses the basic `db` database implemented in `db.go`. This database supports
insertions, deletions, transactions, triggers and querying.

The `db` holds the tables defined in `table.go`, and each table is simply a
collection of `row`s. Each `row` is in turn an instance of one of the types
defined in the `db` directory - e.g. `Cluster` or `Machine`. Note that a
`table` holds instances of exactly one type. For instance, in `ClusterTable`,
each `row` is an instance of `Cluster`; in `ConnectionTable`, each `row` is an
instance of `Connection`, and so on. Because of this structure, a given row can
only appear in exactly one table, and the developer therefore performs
insertions, deletions and transactions on the `db`, rather than on specific
tables. Because there is only one possible `table` for any given `row`, this is
safe.

The canonical way to query the database is by calling a `SelectFromX` function
on the `db`. There is a `SelectFromX` function for each type `X` that is stored
in the database. For instance, to query for `Connection`s in the
`ConnectionTable`, one should use `SelectFromConnection`.

### Quilt Global

The first thing that happens when Quilt starts is that your blueprint is parsed
by Quilt's JavaScript library, `quilt.js`. `quilt.js` then puts the connection
and container specifications into a sensible format and forwards them to the
`engine`.

The `engine` is responsible for keeping the `db` updated so it always reflects
the desired state of the system. It does so by computing a diff of the config
 and the current state stored in the database. After identifying the
differences, `engine` determines the least disruptive way to update the
database to the correct state, and then performs these updates. Notice that the
`engine` only updates the database, not the actual remote system - `cloud`
takes care of that.

The `cloud` takes care of making the state of your system equal to the state
of the database. `cloud` continuously checks for updates to the database, and
whenever the state changes, `cloud` boots or terminates VMs in you system to
reflect the changes in the `db`.

Now that VMs are running, the `minion` container will take care of starting the
necessary system containers on its host VM. The `foreman` acts like the middle
man between your locally run Quilt Global, and the `minion` on the VMs. Namely,
the `foreman` configures the `minion`, notifies it of its (the `minion`'s)
role, and passes it the policies from Quilt Global.

All of these steps are done continuously so the blueprint, database and
remote system always agree on the state of the system.

### Quilt Remote

As described above, `cloud` is responsible for booting VMs. On boot, each VM
runs docker and a `minion`. The VM is furthermore assigned a role - either
`worker` or `master` - which determines what tasks it will carry out. The
`master` minion is responsible for control related tasks, whereas the `worker`
VMs do "the actual work" - that is, they run containers. When the user
specifies a new container the config file, the scheduler will choose a worker
VM to boot this container on. The `minion` on the chosen VM is then notified,
and will boot the new container on its host. The `minion` is similarly
responsible for tearing down containers on its host VM.

While it is possible to boot multiple `master` VMs, there is only one effective
`master` at any given time. The remaining `master` VMs simply perform as
backups in case the leading `master` fails.
